This was created by Peter Storm (pqs4@cornell.edu) to scrape and compile data for water districts from spatial data.

ArcPy is the primary Python library utilized and requires an ESRI license to run this code. As such, Python 2.7.12 was used.

Most datafiles need to be downloaded prior to running this script. Links to the data are located within their given folders in ~/data/.

The following folders require attention: /n
~/data/atlas_i15_CropMapping2014 /n
~/data/kern_county_permit_data /n
~/data/water_district_shape_files /n

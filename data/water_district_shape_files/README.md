These contain the shapefiles for all water districts within the state of California.


Shapefiles used to define the boundaries of water districts were provided by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The California DWR provided is the most comprehensive dataset currently available and is updated when time permits (based on written communications with California DWR Water Resources Engineer, Paul Shipman, P.E.). It is compiled by the California DWR from the United States Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Public Health, and internal California DWR sources. The files are located at the following location: https://gis.water.ca.gov/app/boundaries/.
